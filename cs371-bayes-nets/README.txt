Variable, Average Conditional Probability, Fraction True

M, 0.01173403899806224, 0.0117373

The alarm is rare as there is no prior evidence of burglary or earthquake
John and Mary rarely call which is consistant with the alarm being rare

M:
Variable, Average Conditional Probability, Fraction True
B, 0.05617237685720724, 0.0561629
E, 0.035861878102693485, 0.0357518

J, 0.17757106002162387, 0.1775753

Mary calling increases the likelihood of there having being a burglary (.0001 to .05)
It also increases the likelihood of an earthquake (.002 to .03)
It also increases the likelihood of the alarm going off (.003 to 0.15)


M + E:
Variable, Average Conditional Probability, Fraction True
B, 0.0031605818469230278, 0.0031543
A, 0.966320023147466, 0.9662778
J, 0.8713361301527643, 0.8714056

With evidence of Mary calling and there being an earthquake, the chance of there being a burglary go down because 

3:

b and c are not conditionally independent 
if you provide evidence for one, the other changes

when there is evidence of a, changing the evidence of b and c doesnt change the stat of the other
