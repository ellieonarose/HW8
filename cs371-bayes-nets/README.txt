Part 2:

No evidence: 
Variable, Average Conditional Probability, Fraction True
B, 9.924668003374055E-4, 9.928E-4
E, 0.002001561850164083, 0.001992
A, 0.0025154754640055446, 0.0025131
J, 0.05213613499184609, 0.0521554
M, 0.01173403899806224, 0.0117373

The alarm is rare as there is no prior evidence of burglary or earthquake
John and Mary rarely call which is consistant with the alarm being rare

M:
Variable, Average Conditional Probability, Fraction True
B, 0.05617237685720724, 0.0561629
E, 0.035861878102693485, 0.0357518
A, 0.1500488509389025, 0.1500836
J, 0.17757106002162387, 0.1775753

Mary calling increases the likelihood of there having being a burglary (.0001 to .05)
It also increases the likelihood of an earthquake (.002 to .03)
It also increases the likelihood of the alarm going off (.003 to 0.15)


M + E:
Variable, Average Conditional Probability, Fraction True
B, 0.0031605818469230278, 0.0031543
A, 0.966320023147466, 0.9662778
J, 0.8713361301527643, 0.8714056

With evidence of Mary calling and there being an earthquake, the chance of there being a burglary go down because there is already a reason
as to why Mary would have called (earthquake). The chances of the alarm having gone off increase significantly because if there is an 
earthquake, we know the alarm will go off, and if Mary called, it is because the alarm went off. This also increases the chances of John 
calling because if the alarm went off, John will call. 

Part 3:
If the trial concludes that b and c are conditionally independent, that means that adding evidence of either b or c does not change the
likelihood of the other happening. If the trial concludes that b and c are not conditionally independent, that means that the evidence of 
b or c would change the chances of the other happening. 

With evidence of only a, b and c are conditionally independent. 
With evidence of only d, b and c are not conditionally independent
With evidence of only e, b and c are not conditionally independent
With evidence of a and d, b and c are not conditionally independent
With evidence of a and e, b and c are not conditionally independent, though the chances in the chances of b and c are to the thousanth place,
so one may be able to argue that the changes are slight enough to consider them conditionally independent. 
With evidence of d and e, b and c are not conditionally independent. 
With evidence of a, d, and e, b and c are not conditionally independent. 

Overall, only when there is evidence of a are b and c truly conditionally independent. 


Part 4: 
With no evidence, the likelihood of a is .1999. With the evidence of d, the chances increase to .425. This is because if d is to happen,
something in the tree above it must have happened. This means that there is a higher chance of a happening than if we didn't know any branches
occured. 

Part 5:
With no evidence, the chance of d is .32. With false evidence of a, the chances of d decrease to .23. This is because, if we know that a didn't 
happen, and d is a descendant of a, that means there is a smaller chance that d would even be possible. 

Part 6:
With evidence of a coma (d), the likelihood of the patient having a brain tumor (c) is .2 and the probability of them having increased total 
serum calcium (b) is .8. This is because if the patient is in a coma, it is because of at least one of the two things. When there is evidence of
a coma and a brain tumor, the chances of there being increased total serum calcium decreases to .5. This is because we already have a cause for 
the coma, and the second diagnosis is less likely. The same effect occurs if we have evidence of b. The chances of a brain tumor decrease to .125.
